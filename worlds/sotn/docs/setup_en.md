# Setup

## ROM

As you know, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (SOTN) is not part of the public domain. You MUST acquire a legal copy 
of the ROM on your own. 

## Generation

You will need a valid YAML file to generate any Archipelago world. SOTN is pretty straight forward so far, so the
template will be within this documentation folder. 


## Emulation

All of this was developed for Bizhawk 2.9.1, and you will additionally need playstation core Nymashock to play. Bizhawk
does not come with the said firmware, so you will have to find it. Octoshock might work, but it is untested.


## Connecting

Load your ap_generated rom (that will be named after your player name based on your yaml), create a save file. 
Once you are able to play as Richter in the prologue, open the SOTN client and 
then run connector_sotn.lua found in data/lua of your base AP folder.
