This is my implementation of adding Castlevania SOTN to AP for my own uses.

* Final Fantasy
* Rogue Legacy
* VVVVVV
* Raft

* Meritous
* Super Metroid/Link to the Past combo randomizer (SMZ3)
* ChecksFinder
* ArchipIDLE
* Hollow Knight
* The Witness
* Sonic Adventure 2: Battle
* Starcraft 2
* Donkey Kong Country 3
* Dark Souls 3
* Super Mario World
* Pokémon Red and Blue

* ... and now, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night

## Setup

SOTN setup specifically can be found [here](/worlds/sotn/docs/sotn_en.md)

Archipelago setup can be found at Archipelago's link above.

There is another implementation of this that will most likely be added to AP. Go check out [this](https://github.com/fdelduque/Archipelago/releases) implementation
This repo is just for my own experience and fun, as this is how I would do SOTN instead of having big patch files

## Contributing

This setup was more done for my own fun. If you want to improve AP implementation, go help the above implementation.
If you like this implementation more, there are some things that could be added and double-checked.

### TODO

add in locations or items. See worlds/sotn/(either locations or items) then data/lua/connector.sotn to add more into there
double check item IDs do not overlap with other games
implement logic that goes beyond the vanilla game. IE some people can fly with claymores.
I am bad at the game, so check out the speedrunners of SOTN to learn more.
Shop randomizer could be added (for now the jewel of open is still there and purchasing it won't work)
music shuffle
more ideas can be inspired by [this](https://github.com/3snowp7im/SotN-Randomizer) as that was the original want for this.
